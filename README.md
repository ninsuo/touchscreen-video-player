Touchscreen Video Player
========================

## What is it?

I'm in a sport club providing LifeFitness equipment. Each machine
incorporate a tablet, offering TV, a few apps, some sports-related 
things and... an Internet browser. For me it meant, "an online video
player" that will play my favorite movies.

Those machines do not store any cookie, and I was too lazy to 
create a query string based session id; so security is only based 
on an ip whitelist.

In my club, exercises automatically stop after 30 minutes maximum, and
you enter "recovery mode" for 5 minutes. But I'm actually running for
1 hour, so I need to go back where the movie offset is. That's
why there's that progression percent and a keyboard to quickly go
back in action.

You can't see it on screenshots above, but the green button starts
the movie and enables fullscreen mode.

This is quite minimal but does the job for me. Note that both my flat
and my club use fiber, I never tested this website on slower connections
(except using my 4G phone at a hotel).

## Installation

First, install the application:

```sh
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
php composer.phar update
php app/console assets:install web --symlink
php app/console doctrine:schema:create
```

If you don't have a web server, you can quickly test the
application by running:

```sh
php app/console server:start
run http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Usage

### Ip whitelist

If you are not whitelisted yet, you'll end up on a page only containing
your ip address instead of videos; use a terminal to whitelist
yourself (don't forget your smartphone when going to the club, just
in case they changed their ip).
 
Available commands are:

```sh
-- add an ip address
php app/console ip:add <your ip>

-- remove an ip address
php app/console ip:remove <ip>

-- list whitelisted ips
php app/console ip:list
```

### Videos

Finally, move your videos to the `web/videos` directory. If you wish not
to move them, create a symbolic link (don't forget to disable
directory indexing in your server configuration, or at least put an
index.html inside the exposed video directory).

You need to convert them to mp4, with a heavy compression to avoid
latency (internet connection isn't always good), such as:

```sh
ffmpeg -i originalMovie.avi -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -preset slow -c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 192k -ac 2 lifefitnessMovie.mp4
```

If you want movie thumbnails, you need to install ffmpeg on your server, 
and allow php to exec(). That's not mandatory though, you'll just have
a fallback image instead.

### Bonus

Encode your whole *.avi movies to compatible video.js .mp4 files with the following command (requires ffmpeg):

```sh
php app/console prepare:videos
```

Create .png thumbnails for a more friendly index (requires ffmpeg):

```sh
php app/console prepare:thumbnails
```

Create animated .gif to ~~feel like on youporn~~ have an AWESOME index
(requires ffmpeg and convert):

```sh
php app/console prepare:animated-thumbnails
```
